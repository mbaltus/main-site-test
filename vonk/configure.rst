Configuring the Vonk server
===========================

The steps you followed to get started will provide you with a basic Vonk server,
that runs on a standard port and keeps the data in memory.
If you need to adjust the port, or want to use a MongoDB or SQL database, you can
configure Vonk by adjusting the `hosting.json` and `appsettings.json` file.
If you want to change the way Vonk logs its information, you can adjust `logsettings.json`.
Here are some examples of how to change the settings.
